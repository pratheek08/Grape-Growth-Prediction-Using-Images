# Grape-Growth-Prediction-Using-Images
This project focuses on utilizing image processing and machine learning techniques to predict the growth patterns of various plant species. By analyzing images captured at different stages of plant growth, I have developed a machine learning model that can accurately forecast the growth trajectory of plants.
